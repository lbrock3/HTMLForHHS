Create a program in HTML. The program contains a list of the following words. Display the word without the "el, la, los, las, un, una, unos, unas".  Tell the user if the missing article is definite or indefinite.  Then create buttons with the choices of  "el, la, los, las, un, una, unos, unas" When the user clicks on a button tell them if they have chose the correct article.  If they did, giv them 1 point and display the next word.  Otherwise keep the score the same and display the next word. Do not repeat a word until all words have been chosen. The user has 2 minutes to get as many correct as possible. Before the game begins it asks the user for their name.  Upon completion of the game Say "Â¡Muy Bien, [USER NAME]! El resultado: [SCORE] correcto!"  Then give the user the option to play again.
